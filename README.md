# Horse-Lol
The game that will be turned into a snes game

This is unifinished, but our goal is to attempt to put Horse-Lol
(a really shitty game, made in -noteably- javascript, html, and css)
in a homebrewed converter and make a snes game.

This is something i wanted to make at age 8, and so, i set out to do 
so now that i-somewhat-have an idea of how to!
